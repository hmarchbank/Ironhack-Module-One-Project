# Ironhack-Module-One-Project




# -- Description 
    This was the project to cap the end of my first module at Ironhack's web development bootcamp. 
    I decided to create a clone of the popular mobile game Three's using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
    I made some of my own additions and changes to the game including a timer mode and making the game functional on 
    both desktop and mobile.  

#  -- Instructions
    Menus can be controlled by cursor or touch.

    The game can be played with the arrow keys on desktop or with directional finger swipes on mobile.


#  -- Demo
    If you would like to try the game out in your browser you can at the following link:
